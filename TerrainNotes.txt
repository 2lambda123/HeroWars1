Notes on Terrain

Natural Terrain:
    Plains - the default terrain, easy to move across for most units, sparse cover
    Forest - harder to move across, dense cover, hiding in fog of war
    Mountain - infantry only, dense elevated cover, extends vision in fog of war
    Road - easy to move across for all ground units, especially important for artillery, no cover
    Bridge - roads that go over water and can be moved under (but not stopped on) by ships
    River - infantry only, low elevation with no cover, try not to fight when you're standing in a river
    Beach
    Sea
    Reef

Buildings:
    Town
    Barracks
    Port
    Aviary
    Castle

Other Ideas:
    Caves - lead to underworld layer
    Monsters - kill for gold, buffs, or an alliance
    Shrines - buff units , summon monsters, etc...
    Portals - teleport units between portals of the same color
    Beacons - turn on/off other map elements (levers)
    Walls and Gates - block non-air unit movement
    Workers who build walls, gates, roads, bridges, chop forests etc...
    Tides that go in and out
    Volcanoes which produce lava
    Wasteland - hurts units standing on it
    Underwater buildings or even an underwater layer
    Desert - slows everyones movement a lot
