Classes:
    Tile
    Gameboard
    Map
    Unit

Tile:


in the init function of tile. you use init with type: type is gonnabe a string.





so Creating the board.

1) Start with an array of types of tiles (strings) from somewhere.

2) The map class contains an array of tiles and a size from which the board will be built

3) This array is passed into the Gameboard method initWithMap, where the list of tiles and the size is turned into a grid which is the basis for the game.

Map File Rules
    All Map files have 3 parts separated by ":"
        these parts are a description, board conditions, and the terms for victory
    Description
        can be anything, this is purely for organizational purposes
    Board Conditions
        these are the tile and unit types and positions for a given board
        "/" separate rows
        "," separate squares in a row
    Squares
        a given square has a tile type character and if applicable a player # and a unit character

How inputManager works so far:
    in scene, you have a touch on a node. The touch is either a tap, hold or drag (all NSStrings).
    The touch type along with the touched node (prop of scene) is passed into the inputManager who calls methods accordingly.


Drag/Hold/Tap
    if the touch moves the drag occurs
    if the touch is held a hold occurs
    if the touch ends a tap occurs

Touch hierarchy (top to bottom):
    Button
    Menu
    Unit
    Building
    Tile
    World
    Scene

Unit Basics
    when you tap a unit you enter the unitMove stage
        the input manager will use a pathing algorithm to figure out what tiles can be moved to
        the scene will then highlight those tiles
    when you click on a highlighted tile you enter the unitAction stage
