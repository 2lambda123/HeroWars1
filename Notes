Hello, welcome to our game.

Classes:
    Tile
    Gameboard
    Map
    Unit

Tile:


in the init function of tile. you use init with type: type is gonnabe a string.





so Creating the board.

1) Start with an array of types of tiles (strings) from somewhere.

2) The map class contains an array of tiles and a size from which the board will be built

3) This array is passed into the Gameboard method initWithMap, where the list of tiles and the size is turned into a grid which is the basis for the game.


How inputManager works so far:
    in scene, you have a touch on a node. The touch is either a tap, hold or drag (all NSStrings).
    The touch type along with the touched node (prop of scene) is passed into the inputManager who calls methods accordingly.
